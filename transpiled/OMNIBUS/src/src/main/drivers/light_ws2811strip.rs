 * "Note that the timing on the WS2812/WS2812B LEDs has changed as of batches from WorldSemi
 * manufactured made in October 2013, and timing tolerance for approx 10-30% of parts is very small.
 * Recommendation from WorldSemi is now: 0 = 400ns high/850ns low, and 1 = 850ns high, 400ns low"
 *
 * Currently the timings are 0 = 350ns high/800ns and 1 = 700ns high/650ns low.

 *
 * HoTT is implemented in Graupner equipment using a bi-directional protocol over a single wire.
 *
 * Generally the receiver sends a single request byte out using normal uart signals, then waits a short period for a
 * multiple byte response and checksum byte before it sends out the next request byte.
 * Each response byte must be send with a protocol specific delay between them.
 *
 * Serial ports use two wires but HoTT uses a single wire so some electronics are required so that
 * the signals don't get mixed up.  When cleanflight transmits it should not receive it's own transmission.
 *
 * Connect as follows:
 * HoTT TX/RX -> Serial RX (connect directly)
 * Serial TX -> 1N4148 Diode -(|  )-> HoTT TX/RX (connect via diode)
 *
 * The diode should be arranged to allow the data signals to flow the right way
 * -(|  )- == Diode, | indicates cathode marker.
 *
 * As noticed by Skrebber the GR-12 (and probably GR-16/24, too) are based on a PIC 24FJ64GA-002, which has 5V tolerant digital pins.
 *
 * Note: The softserial ports are not listed as 5V tolerant in the STM32F103xx data sheet pinouts and pin description
 * section.  Verify if you require a 5v/3.3v level shifters.  The softserial port should not be inverted.
 *
 * There is a technical discussion (in German) about HoTT here

// NONE initializer for IO_t variable
// both ioTag_t and IO_t are guarantied to be zero if pinid is NONE (no pin)
// this simplifies initialization (globals are zeroed on start) and allows
//  omitting unused fields in structure initializers.
// it is also possible to use IO_t and ioTag_t as boolean value
//   TODO - this may conflict with requirement to generate warning/error on IO_t - ioTag_t assignment
//   IO_t being pointer is only possibility I know of ..
// pin config handling
// pin config is packed into ioConfig_t to decrease memory requirements
// IOCFG_x macros are defined for common combinations for all CPUs; this
//  helps masking CPU differences
